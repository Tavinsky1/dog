# DogAtlas Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Multi-City Dog-Friendly Platform
DogAtlas is a comprehensive platform for dog owners to discover and review dog-friendly places across multiple cities. Every feature must support this core mission of connecting dog owners with safe, enjoyable locations for their pets.

### II. User-Centric Design
All features prioritize the user experience for dog owners, moderators, and place owners. The platform must be intuitive, accessible, and provide real value through community-driven content and reviews.

### III. Data Integrity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All place data, reviews, and user-generated content must maintain the highest standards of accuracy and authenticity. Automated validation, community moderation, and quality controls are mandatory.

### IV. Scalable Architecture
The platform must support growth across multiple cities and categories while maintaining performance. Database optimization, efficient caching, and modular architecture are required.

### V. Community-Driven Content
User reviews and place submissions form the core value proposition. Features must encourage active participation while maintaining content quality through moderation systems.

## Technical Standards

### Database & API
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type safety
- RESTful API design with consistent error handling
- Database migrations must be backward compatible
- API versioning for breaking changes

### Frontend
- Next.js 15 with App Router for optimal performance
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive design
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements

### Security & Privacy
- JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing
- Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs
- GDPR compliance for user data handling
- Secure file upload handling for place photos

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical features
- Code reviews required for all changes

### Feature Development
- Features must be thoroughly specified before implementation
- User stories and acceptance criteria required
- Database schema changes require migration planning
- Performance impact assessment for new features

### Deployment & Operations
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Database backups and recovery procedures
- Monitoring and logging for production issues
- Rollback procedures for failed deployments

## Governance

This constitution serves as the foundation for all DogAtlas development decisions. All features, architectural changes, and process modifications must align with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require consensus from the development team and clear documentation of the rationale and impact.
