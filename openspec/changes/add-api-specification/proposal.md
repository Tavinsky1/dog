# Add API Specification

## Why
The DogAtlas API currently lacks formal documentation, making it difficult for developers to understand and integrate with the API. Without standardized specifications, frontend development, mobile app integration, and third-party partnerships are hindered by unclear endpoint definitions, inconsistent error handling, and undocumented authentication requirements.

## What Changes
- Add comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specification for all DogAtlas API endpoints
- Document RESTful endpoints for places, reviews, authentication, and administration
- Define request/response schemas with JSON Schema validation
- Specify authentication requirements using NextAuth.js JWT tokens
- Standardize error handling and HTTP status codes across all endpoints
- Document pagination patterns and rate limiting information
- Provide example requests and responses for common use cases

## Impact
- Affected specs: http-server capability (new)
- Affected code: All API routes in `/src/app/api/`
- Breaking changes: None (documentation only)
- Testing: New API contract tests can be added
- Documentation: Swagger UI website for API exploration
