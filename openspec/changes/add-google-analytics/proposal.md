# Proposal: Add Google Analytics Integration

**Change ID:** `add-google-analytics`  
**Status:** DRAFT  
**Created:** 2025-10-28  
**Priority:** HIGH

## Problem Statement

The application currently has no analytics tracking, making it impossible to:
- Understand user behavior and engagement
- Track conversion funnels
- Measure feature adoption
- Optimize marketing campaigns
- Make data-driven product decisions

## Proposed Solution

Implement Google Analytics 4 (GA4) with:
- Page view tracking
- Event tracking for key user actions
- Custom dimensions for dog-specific metrics
- E-commerce tracking (future monetization)
- User journey analysis

### Key Events to Track:
1. **Place Discovery:**
   - Search performed
   - Place viewed
   - Place category filtered
   - Map view toggled

2. **User Engagement:**
   - Review submitted
   - Photo uploaded
   - Place favorited
   - Place shared

3. **Conversion Events:**
   - Account created
   - First place visited
   - First review written
   - Premium upgrade (future)

4. **Navigation:**
   - City changed
   - Menu interactions
   - External link clicks (directions, website)

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Setup Google Analytics Account
- Create GA4 property for dog-atlas.com
- Configure data streams
- Get Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
- Set up custom events and dimensions

### 2. Code Implementation
- Create `<GoogleAnalytics />` component
- Add analytics script to root layout
- Create `trackEvent()` utility function
- Implement automatic page view tracking
- Add event tracking to key UI components

### 3. Custom Dimensions
- User role (USER, EDITOR, ADMIN)
- City being viewed
- Place category
- Dog size (if user profile exists)
- Authenticated vs anonymous

### 4. Privacy Compliance
- Add cookie consent banner
- Update Privacy Policy
- Implement opt-out mechanism
- Anonymize IP addresses
- Comply with GDPR/CCPA

## Success Criteria

- [ ] GA4 tracking code loads on all pages
- [ ] Page views tracked accurately
- [ ] Key events fire correctly
- [ ] Real-time data visible in GA dashboard
- [ ] No impact on page load performance (<50ms overhead)
- [ ] Cookie consent implemented
- [ ] Privacy policy updated

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_DEBUG="false"  # true for development
```

### Performance Considerations:
- Load scripts with `strategy="afterInteractive"`
- Use Next.js Script component for optimization
- Lazy load analytics on user interaction
- Minimize custom event payload size

## Timeline

- Day 1: Setup GA4 account and implementation
- Day 2: Add event tracking throughout app
- Day 3: Cookie consent and privacy updates
- Day 4: Testing and validation
- Day 5: Production deployment

## Dependencies

- Google Analytics account
- Privacy policy updates
- Cookie consent library (optional: react-cookie-consent)
