    fullDescription: `London is one of the world's best cities for dog-friendly pubs. Here's how to make the most of them:

**Finding Pubs:**
Most traditional pubs welcome dogs - chains like JD Wetherspoon, Fuller's, and Young's are reliably dog-friendly. Apps like DoggiePubs help find specific venues.

**Etiquette:**
Keep dogs on leads in pubs. Bring a mat for them to lie on. Keep away from food service areas. Clean up any accidents immediately.

**Best Areas:**
Almost everywhere! North London (Hampstead, Highgate), East London (Hackney, Dalston), and South London (Clapham, Brixton) are particularly dog-pub rich.

**Tips:**
Arrive before it gets busy for the best spots. Outdoor areas are usually safest. Most pubs have water bowls - just ask if you don't see one.`,

**The Basics:**
Dogs travel FREE on all TfL services (Tube, bus, Overground, DLR, trams). No ticket needed. Must be on lead at all times.

**Escalators:**
Carry small dogs or use the lift. Large dogs should be trained to ride escalators, or use stairs/lifts.

**Busy Times:**
Avoid peak hours (7:30-9:30am, 5-7pm) if possible. Some stations get dangerously crowded. Weekend mornings are best.

**Accessibility:**
Most stations now have step-free access - great for dogs nervous of escalators. Check TfL website for specific station info.

**Thames Clippers:**
Dogs welcome on river buses! Great alternative to the Tube for central London journeys.`,

    fullDescription: `Timing can make or break a park visit. Here's the insider guide:

**Early Morning (6-8am):**
The golden hour for dog walkers. Parks are quiet, dogs can run freely, and you'll meet the regular dog-walking community.

**Mid-Morning (9-11am):**
Parks start to fill up. Still good for walking but more activity to navigate.

**Afternoon:**
Generally busier, especially in summer. More people, picnics, and children. Keep dogs closer.

**Evening (6-8pm):**
Another good window. After-work dog walkers create a friendly community atmosphere.

**Seasonal Notes:**
Summer weekends are busiest. Winter mornings are magical but cold. Spring and autumn are the sweet spots.`,

**Richmond Park:**
Several ponds - Pen Ponds are popular but watch for fishing lines. Adam's Pond is good for dogs.

**Victoria Park:**
The lakes allow paddling but not full swimming. Good for cooling off.

**Safety Tips:**
Check water quality before letting dogs swim. Blue-green algae is dangerous - avoid water with unusual color or scum. Dry dogs thoroughly after swimming.`,

**Recall is Key:**
Only let your dog off-leash if they reliably come when called. Practice regularly.

**Reading Situations:**
Put your dog on lead when passing other dogs on leads, near playgrounds, or when asked.

**Right of Way:**
On-leash dogs have priority on paths. Keep your off-leash dog away from them.

**Not Everyone Loves Dogs:**
Respect people who are nervous or don't want contact. Call your dog away from picnics and children.

**Wildlife:**
During bird nesting season (March-July), keep dogs away from long grass and reed beds. Squirrel chasing is generally tolerated but controversial.`,

**Summer:**
Heat stroke risk - walk early/late, carry water. Hot pavements can burn paws. Blue-green algae in stagnant water.

**Autumn:**
Conkers and acorns are toxic to dogs. Darker evenings - use reflective gear. Fireworks season means anxious dogs.

**Winter:**
Antifreeze is deadly - watch for spills. Rock salt irritates paws - wash after walks. Ice on ponds is treacherous.

**Year-Round:**
Rat poison in urban areas. Dropped food (kebabs, chicken bones). Other dogs - not all are friendly.`,

**Updating Details:**
When you move house or change phone number, update your microchip database IMMEDIATELY. This is often forgotten and means lost dogs can't be returned.

**Databases:**
Petlog, Identibase, and others. Find out which database your dog is registered with and keep login details safe.

**Checking:**
Vets can scan chips for free. Good to check it's still working, especially for older dogs.

**Collars:**
In addition to microchips, dogs must wear a collar with owner's name and address in public (not phone number legally required, but sensible).`,

Safe for dogs with poor recall. Controlled environment. Good for socializing puppies.

**Cons:**
Can get crowded. Sometimes dominated by certain cliques. Not all dogs enjoy the intensity.

**Where to Look:**
OpenRent, SpareRoom (filter for pet-friendly), and estate agents - be upfront about having a dog.

**Good Areas:**
Properties with gardens are more likely to allow dogs. Areas like Hackney, Peckham, and outer boroughs have more options.
