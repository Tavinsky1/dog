# ✅ PHOTO PROBLEM FIXED

## What Was Wrong

The places had NO photos showing because:
1. All `imageUrl` fields were `null` in the database
2. The frontend was checking `if (place.imageUrl)` before showing ANY image
3. Result: **Blank cards with no images**

## Solution Implemented

Added **category-specific placeholder images** from Unsplash that automatically show when no photo exists:

- **Parks**: Green park scenery
- **Cafés & Restaurants**: Cozy café interior
- **Accommodation**: Hotel rooms
- **Shops & Services**: Pet shop vibes
- **Walks & Trails**: Scenic trails
- **Tips & Local Info**: City guides

### Code Change

Updated `/src/app/[city]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Before (broken):
{place.imageUrl && (
  <div><img src={place.imageUrl} /></div>
)}

// After (fixed):
<div>
  <img src={place.imageUrl || getPlaceholderImage(place.type)} />
</div>
```

Now EVERY place has an image - either their real photo or a beautiful category-appropriate placeholder.

## What's Running

- **Dev server**: http://localhost:3000
- **Database**: Fully restored with 166 places, 4 cities
- **Backups**: Active protection system

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want real venue photos later:

1. **From websites** (complex, many fail):
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/import_photos_from_web.ts
   ```

2. **Manual upload** (best quality):
   - Go to Admin panel
   - Upload photos for specific places
   - They'll override the placeholders

3. **From a photo API** (paid):
   - Google Places API
   - Unsplash API with place names
   - Pexels API

## Current Status

✅ All places visible with appropriate images
✅ Clean, professional look
✅ No more blank cards
✅ No more same placeholder for everything
✅ Category-specific visuals help users navigate

**The photo problem is SOLVED.** Every place now has a relevant, attractive image.
