# DOGGYWORLD Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Tasks are organized by phases with parallelizable items marked [P]. Each phase includes validation gates to ensure quality.

## Phase 1: Foundations
**Goal:** Set up development environment and core infrastructure.

### 1.1 Project Setup [P]
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint
- [ ] Configure project structure (src/, prisma/, etc.)
- [ ] Set up environment variables (.env.local)
- [ ] Install core dependencies (Prisma, NextAuth, Leaflet, etc.)

### 1.2 Database Setup
- [ ] Create Prisma schema with all models and enums
- [ ] Generate Prisma client
- [ ] Set up database connection and migrations
- [ ] Create database indexes for performance

### 1.3 Authentication Setup
- [ ] Configure NextAuth.js with credentials and Google providers
- [ ] Set up JWT sessions with role support
- [ ] Create auth middleware and protected routes

**Gate:** Database connects, auth flows work, project builds.

## Phase 2: Contracts & Tests (Red)
**Goal:** Define and test API contracts before implementation.

### 2.1 API Contract Tests
- [ ] Create test setup with isolated test database
- [ ] Write contract tests for GET /api/cities
- [ ] Write contract tests for GET /api/[city]/places
- [ ] Write contract tests for GET /api/[city]/places/[slug]
- [ ] Write contract tests for GET/POST /api/user/favorites
- [ ] Write contract tests for POST /api/admin/ingest
- [ ] Write contract tests for POST /api/admin/ingest/[jobId]/apply

### 2.2 CSV Contract Tests
- [ ] Write tests for CSV parsing and validation
- [ ] Test UUIDv5 generation for missing IDs
- [ ] Test array field processing (gallery, amenities, tags)
- [ ] Test error collection and reporting

**Gate:** All contract tests fail (red) but run without crashes.

## Phase 3: Minimal Implementation (Green)
**Goal:** Build minimal code to make contract tests pass.

### 3.1 Core API Routes
- [ ] Implement GET /api/cities with city listing
- [ ] Implement GET /api/[city]/places with filtering
- [ ] Implement GET /api/[city]/places/[slug] with full details
- [ ] Implement GET/POST /api/user/favorites with auth checks
- [ ] Implement POST /api/admin/ingest with CSV validation
- [ ] Implement POST /api/admin/ingest/[jobId]/apply with data import

### 3.2 CSV Utilities
- [ ] Create CSV parser with streaming support
- [ ] Implement row normalization with Zod validation
- [ ] Add UUIDv5 generation for missing IDs
- [ ] Handle array field splitting and processing

### 3.3 Authentication Routes
- [ ] Create /api/auth/[...nextauth] route
- [ ] Implement /api/auth/signup with validation
- [ ] Add role-based middleware

**Gate:** All contract tests pass (green), basic API functionality works.

## Phase 4: Pages & UI
**Goal:** Build user-facing pages and components.

### 4.1 Core Pages
- [ ] Create home page (/) with city links
- [ ] Create city page (/[city]) with map and place list
- [ ] Create place detail page (/[city]/p/[slug])
- [ ] Create signup page (/signup)
- [ ] Create login page (/login)

### 4.2 Components
- [ ] Build Map component with Leaflet integration
- [ ] Create place card components
- [ ] Add filter/search UI components
- [ ] Implement favorite toggle buttons

### 4.3 Admin Interface
- [ ] Create admin ingest page (/admin/ingest)
- [ ] Add CSV upload and validation UI
- [ ] Display validation results and errors

**Gate:** All pages load, basic navigation works, quickstart scenarios 1-2 pass.

## Phase 5: Quality Assurance
**Goal:** Polish implementation and ensure production readiness.

### 5.1 Authentication Integration
- [ ] Integrate auth with favorites functionality
- [ ] Add login/logout UI components
- [ ] Implement protected route guards

### 5.2 Data Seeding
- [ ] Create seed script for initial cities/places
- [ ] Test with realistic data volumes
- [ ] Verify data integrity and relationships

### 5.3 Error Handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Implement user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring hooks

**Gate:** Quickstart scenarios 3-4 pass, no critical bugs.

## Phase 6: Performance & Polish
**Goal:** Optimize and finalize for production.

### 6.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add database query optimization
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize bundle size and loading

### 6.2 Accessibility & UX
- [ ] Audit and fix accessibility issues
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add loading states and transitions

### 6.3 Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical flows
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Add deployment configuration

**Gate:** All quickstart scenarios pass, performance targets met, accessibility compliant.

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority
- **Database performance:** Monitor query performance, add indexes early
- **Auth security:** Implement proper password hashing and session management
- **CSV validation:** Thoroughly test edge cases and error handling

### Medium Priority
- **Map performance:** Lazy load Leaflet, optimize marker rendering
- **Mobile UX:** Test on various devices, ensure touch targets adequate
- **SEO:** Add meta tags and structured data for places

### Low Priority
- **Internationalization:** Plan for future multi-language support
- **Advanced features:** Keep scope limited to MVP requirements

## Parallelizable Tasks [P]
Tasks marked [P] can be worked on simultaneously by different team members or in parallel development streams. Focus on completing foundation tasks first before branching into parallel work.

## Dependencies
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 completion (contracts defined)
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 completion (APIs working)
- UI work (Phase 4) can begin in parallel with API work once contracts are defined
- Testing should happen continuously, not just at phase gates
