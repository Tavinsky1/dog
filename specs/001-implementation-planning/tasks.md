# Tasks: DogAtlas Platform Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-implementation-planning/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Next.js 15.4.6, TypeScript 5.0, Prisma ORM, SQLite/PostgreSQL
   → Structure: Single Next.js project with app router
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities (User, City, Place, Review, Favorite)
   → contracts/: API contracts for places, cities, reviews, favorites, user
   → research.md: NextAuth.js, Tailwind CSS, Vercel deployment
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Project init, Prisma schema, NextAuth config
   → Tests: Contract tests, integration tests for user stories
   → Core: Prisma models, API routes, authentication
   → Integration: Database connections, middleware, external services
   → Polish: UI components, performance, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different API routes = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js App**: `app/` for routes, `lib/` for utilities, `prisma/` for schema
- **API Routes**: `app/api/` directory structure
- **Components**: `components/` directory
- **Tests**: `tests/` directory (Jest + React Testing Library)

## Dependencies & Execution Order
**Sequential Dependencies:**
- T009-T010 must complete before any API implementation (T011-T018)
- T019-T023 (auth) must complete before user-specific features
- T030-T032 (photo models) must complete before T033-T035 (photo UI)
- T036-T040 (city pages) depend on T013 (places API)
- T041-T045 (reviews) depend on T014 (reviews API)

**Parallel Execution Groups:**
- API routes (T011-T015) can run in parallel
- UI components (T024-T029) can run in parallel after APIs
- Tests (T001-T008) can run in parallel but must precede implementation
- Unit tests (T056-T057) can run in parallel

## Validation Checkpoints
- **After T010**: Database schema validates and migrations run successfully
- **After T018**: All API endpoints return valid responses
- **After T035**: Photo upload workflow functions end-to-end
- **After T045**: Review system allows creation, display, and moderation
- **After T050**: Admin interface allows content management
- **After T063**: All user stories from specification work correctly</content>
