Perfect timing — now that you’ve clarified the category architecture (4 featured lifestyle + 5 service categories), I’ll rebuild the Manus prompt so it matches DogAtlas exactly. This way Manus won’t invent categories, and the data will align with our Prisma schema + UI tabs out of the box.

Here’s the remade prompt (ready to paste into Manus):

⸻

📌 Prompt for Manus: DogAtlas Deep Research → Import-Ready Data

Project: DogAtlas — Next.js (App Router) + Prisma + Tailwind
Goal: Populate DogAtlas with real places + reviews across Berlin, structured into 9 fixed categories, in import-ready JSONL files for Visual Studio Code + Copilot.

⸻

✅ Categories (must match exactly)

🏠 Featured (Homepage)
	1.	cafe_restaurant_bar → Paws & Patios
“Dog-friendly cafés, restaurants & bars with outdoor seating”
	2.	park_offleash_area → Parks & Play
“Off-leash areas, dog parks & recreational spaces”
	3.	lake_swim → Splash & Swim
“Lakes, beaches & swimming spots for water-loving dogs”
	4.	trail_hike → Trails & Treks
“Hiking trails, forest paths & scenic walking routes”

🏙️ City-specific (Berlin & other cities)
	5.	pet_store_boutique → Pet Stores
“Pet supplies and boutique shops”
	6.	vet_clinic_hospital → Veterinary Services
“Clinics, hospitals and emergency care”
	7.	dog_groomer → Dog Groomers
“Professional grooming and spa services”
	8.	dog_hotel_boarding → Dog Hotels
“Boarding, daycare and accommodation”
	9.	dog_walker_trainer → Trainers & Walkers
“Professional training and walking services”

⚠️ No other categories should appear. Each place must belong to exactly one of these.

🔍 Research Sources
	•	Primary: Google Places API (legal usage) → place details, ratings, website, opening hours, photos metadata, aggregated reviews.
	•	Secondary: OpenStreetMap (parks, dog meadows, trails, off-leash areas).
	•	Local Data: Berlin Open Data (official Hundewiesen, leash rules, algae alerts).
	•	Supplementary: TripAdvisor, Yelp, Reddit (r/berlin, r/dogs), dog forums, blogs, venue websites.
	•	Licensing: No scraping behind logins. Reviews = star rating + short paraphrase (<280 chars) + source URL.

📌 Definition of Done: /data/berlin/ delivered with 1k+ real places across categories, clean JSONL files, sources documented, and coverage stats ready for import.

⸻

👉 Tavo, would you like me to also draft the importer script (e.g. scripts/import_reviews.ts) so once Manus gives us the JSONL, you can run pnpm ts-node scripts/import_reviews.ts and load reviews straight into Prisma? That way we close the loop.
