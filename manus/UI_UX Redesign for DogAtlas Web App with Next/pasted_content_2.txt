Perfect ✅ — a README.md will help you (and Manus) stay on track when swapping files in and out of Visual Studio Code.
Here’s a clean draft tailored for your DogAtlas project:

🐾 DogAtlas – UI/UX Overhaul

This project is a Next.js 14 + Prisma + TailwindCSS web app for discovering dog-friendly places (parks, cafés, vets, trails, groomers, hotels, trainers, etc.) starting with Berlin and later expanding worldwide.

	•	SEO improvements:
	•	JSON-LD with reviews.
	•	robots.txt + sitemap.

	•	Highlight top categories with visual cards.
	2.	Category Pages
	•	Display category banner image.
	•	Show results in card grid with rating stars, tags, and photos.
	3.	Place Pages

👉 This README should be placed in the root of your project so Manus and you both know exactly where files go and what has changed.

Do you want me to also add a design guideline section (colors, typography, spacing rules) so Manus doesn’t just freestyle but keeps it consistent? That would make the UI more professional and future-proof.
