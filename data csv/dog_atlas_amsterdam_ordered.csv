Oosterpark Hondenlosloopgebied,park_offleash_area,Amsterdam,Netherlands,52.3615,4.9200,"A designated off-leash dog area in the beautiful Oosterpark, perfect for urban dogs.","Oosterpark's off-leash area is a great urban spot for dogs to run and socialize. The area is a mix of grass and dirt, and while not fully fenced, it is a designated zone where dogs can roam freely. The park has plenty of shade and benches for owners to sit on. It's a popular meeting spot for local dog owners, especially in the evenings. The park can get lively, so it's a good place for social dogs. It's a very convenient location for those living in the east of the city.","4","Dogs must be on a leash when outside the designated zone. Owners are responsible for cleaning up waste. Ensure your dog has good recall.","http://www.oosterpark.amsterdam","+31 20 111 2235","info@oosterpark.nl","free","Mon-Sun: 08:00-21:00","4.2","City Park Guide","[""Open Area"", ""Grassy Areas"", ""Shade Trees"", ""Benches"", ""Waste Bags""]","[""off-leash"", ""park"", ""urban"", ""social"", ""Oosterpark""]","[""https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596753738148-e87771746285"", ""https://images.pexels.com/photos/10178492/pexels-photo-10178492.jpeg"", ""https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588941913575-b4676571a8f9""]"
